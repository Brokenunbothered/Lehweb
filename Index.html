<p> About me:Hello I am Broken! I am the creator of the show Paying Paper, If you wondering what Paying Paper is it is a show about a stick-figure named Till. He goes on WaCkY adventures. The idea for the show was boiling in my mind since March of 2021! The show is animated in a little program known as Flash 8. Bye.<p/>

<p> Sometimes I create music. </p>
